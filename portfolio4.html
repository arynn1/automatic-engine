                        <h2>Reaction/Analysis paper </h2>
                        <p>
                            As I researched the topic at hand, I started to think about how much more integrated hardware and software will become in my life. The thought of eventually being the one creating programs for various applications makes me excited for the future. I was so engrossed in the topic that I completed this entire portfolio in just a few hours. This is my analysis and reaction to my Portfolio #4 of ITC.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hardware and software work in tandem to create convenience in our lives. From the obvious to the unseen, computer systems are everywhere. This portfolio reinforced the notion in my head that computers are the pinnacle of human advancement in today’s society. With unlimited use cases, computers and their components are complex yet designed for our everyday use. Our lives have become much easier due to the integration of computers. From work and education to leisure and entertainment, computers have penetrated every facet of society, becoming one with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the recent advancements in AI technology, computing has taken another step toward the future. While it may have flaws now, we could very well see a future with robots being of service to us. We must be careful during this turbulent time of advancement to ensure progress benefits all, not just a few.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I conclude my analysis and reaction paper, I reflect on how the world has changed since the first computers were invented. Now, we have computers in our pockets more powerful than the first mainframes of the 1950s. Computers used for menial tasks today, like ordering food, are more powerful than those used during World War II. This gives us an opportunity to do more than just order takeout from Jollibee; we can learn, improve, and make ourselves brand new through computers. With the internet as a repository of all human knowledge, and a network to connect us around the world, we can become our best selves. Learning about hardware and software implementation has made it clear that to learn what we want is simpler than ever before.
