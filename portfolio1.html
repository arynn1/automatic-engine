                    <h1>Reaction/Analysis paper</h1>
                    <p>
                        Computing and its various disciplines are diverse in their applications in the real world. From Computer science for researching the impact of climate change, computer engineering for the development of consumer devices such as smartphones, Information technologies for tech support and maintaining networks, Information systems for data management in big corporations, and Software engineering for the development of everyday use applications, the term ‘computing’ has become an umbrella term for such tasks. As Alan Turing once said, “Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible.”, we have created a way for the future through technology. In this reaction paper, I impart my thoughts on the topic which I have thoroughly researched, collating my ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I first started studying computers, I could never have imagined that they could be so broad in their applications. Through researching all the different disciplines, I have come to realize that computing isn't all about coding programs or building devices. It is a plethora of ideas mashed together to form networks, firmware, data structures, and much more. It is a way to solve problems that we as humans have evolved into. Leading the future in technology, we have created a new language of innovation. With the emergence of AI, computing is in a new age of development, and through this, it gives more people a facet to grow and improve but also lets them have viable jobs for their interests. I am sure that these disciplines will expand even further in the future, creating branches of science that are yet to be known. Pursuing a career in one of these fields is a commendable act, as we aim higher and higher in the advancement of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, computing as a language has infinite possibilities such as AI, healthcare, data science, and much more. As we study and develop new ways to solve humanity's problems, we evolve as a species. Having technology as a facet of our growth, we implement these needs through computing and its different disciplines. You may be developing software, managing data, etc…, regardless of your field, you are forging a way toward the future. We may not know what lies ahead of us, but we can see the next step, so that is the way we will take.
