                            Information systems or IS are sociotechnical, formal, and organizational systems developed to store, process, and share information throughout a given group or business. They integrate into businesses to support decision-making and operations in general. They are composed of 4 parts:

                        <p>
                            TPS or transactional processing systems are a type of information system that is mainly used for day-to-day transactions. It manages most activities regarding money and assets including payroll, reservations, sales, orders, etc. It provides data to other systems and is used by supervisors and operational personnel.

                        <p>
                            MIS or Management Information Systems are used to make informed decisions with performance metrics and data from TPS and other systems. They are important to summarize information gained to support businesses in making efficient plans and good decisions. These systems are used by middle managers and department heads.

                        <p>
                            DSS or Decision Support Systems are systems used to analyze data and help managers make decisions that are supported by data and evaluate potential outcomes for a more informed choice. These systems are used in logistics, financial planning, and more and are utilized by analysts and senior management.

                        <h1>Reaction/Analysis paper</h1>
                                <p>
                                Information systems are an integral part of the flow of businesses in our society today. It regulates, improves, and overall supports business owners and employees alike. Through its various use cases, it has revolutionized the world of business technology. Decision-making has been easier through TPS, MIS, and other support systems. With the amount of data you can access using these systems, your decision-making will be more efficient and less time-consuming. In this reaction paper, I analyze and describe the topic of IS, which I have researched thoroughly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Before coming into this topic, I did not know anything about Information Systems at all. I heard about them but nothing came to mind. Throughout this portfolio I have made, I came to learn of its importance in business and technology as a whole. Through these systems, we acquire, process, and disseminate information within a business. This topic has opened my eyes to the infinite applications of technology. These systems are likely used in all if not most companies nowadays. With the innovations and the revolutionization of technology in all aspects of our lives, these systems take shape to improve our Quality of Life.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Apps like Gcash, Paymaya, and other banks heavily rely on Transactional Processing Systems and other systems to manage money. Without this system, we would not be able to have easy access to our money like we do now. Hotels, stores, online shops, etc., all have in one form or another, support systems that streamline the processes within a business. These systems have saved us time, energy, and money, and improved our lives. Most businesses have become reliant on these systems especially large corporations with their innumerable amount of data which they need to analyze and judge using Information Systems.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                In conclusion, these systems are the backbone of businesses worldwide. Without these systems, we would not be able to access these luxuries easily. IS has improved our lives, may we notice it or not. Technology as a whole has been integrated heavily into our lifestyles and cannot be easily replaced. This is just one of many examples of such a situation.
