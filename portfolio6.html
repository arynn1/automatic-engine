                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a comparative analysis of the different types of computers and their uses. In this paper, I enumerate the types of computers, their specifications, and their different use cases.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Discussion</h2>
                    <p>
                        These types of computers all differ from one another and are all made with a specific goal in mind. From the giant supercomputers that help solve the world's problems to the humble microcomputers that help you solve your problems. To show this difference, we have this comparison of 4 similar but very different types of computers:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mini Computer:</strong> Generally 1-4GHz, capable of basic computational tasks and moderate workloads, depending on the brand and model. Ranges from 4-64GB of RAM, used for personal uses and moderate workloads. Power consumption: 4-13W idle, 30-100W with load.</li>
                        <li><strong>Micro Computer:</strong> Generally lower processing speed than mini-computers, 1-3GHz. Designed for everyday tasks like web browsing and document editing. Ranges from 2-32GB of RAM, used for education and personal uses. Power consumption: 3.8-10W idle, 20-50W with load.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workstation:</strong> High processing speeds, often exceeding 4GHz. Equipped with multi-core processors up to 32 cores for intensive workloads such as CAD and video editing. Ranges from 16-512GB of RAM, used for complex calculations and engineering design. Power consumption: 50-150W idle, 200-800W with load.</li>
                        <li><strong>Server:</strong> Very high processing speeds optimized for handling multiple requests simultaneously, exceeding 4GHz for each core. Can manage vast amounts of data at once. Ranges from 32GB to several TB of RAM, used for running vast amounts of operations. Power consumption: 100-300W idle, 500 to several kilowatts under load.</li>
                    </ul>
